# URXVT
- [X] C-A C / C-A V
- [X] use client/daemon
- [ ] C arrows to move around : is it really necessary ? can use emacs controls
- [ ] begin/end of line : ???
- [X] vim visual line does not show in urxvt
- [X] segfault with urxvt : usecase : tabbed/stacked or only window. No issue when in split view: test without any options: no trouble without options. One of mine makes it blow out.
- [ ] perl: url-picker launcher for hyperlinks
