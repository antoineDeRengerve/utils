- [X] move to begin/end of line with home/end
- [X] vim visual line does not show in urxvt
- [X] segfault with urxvt : usecase : tabbed/stacked or only window. No issue when in split view: test without any options: no trouble without options. One of mine makes it blow out.
- [X] perl: url-picker launcher for hyperlinks
- [X] learn more about emacs control in terminal like urxvt
- [X] clipboard : auto clipboard for selection + C-S c/v for copying : selection-to-clipboard OK and C-M C/V is OK.
- [X] add xsel in dependencies
- [X] opening terminal in new place not ok for urxvtc ? Should not be using urxvtc, keeping service and socket.
- [X] remove service daemon as it does not work correctly with xwcd. Keeping service just in case.
